# Sculk
Sculk is a scripting language designed to compile into Minecraft datapacks. Using Sculk, you can easily create datapacks with complex functionalities and logic while remaining in the comfort of a simple and easy language.

# Motivation
Minecraft possesses a wide variety of commands in the game. Most of them are easy to learn and use, and often just perform one singular task. Originally, commands were only meant to be administrative actions that players can do - nothing more, nothing less.

However, players eventually noticed that with some clever tricks and techniques, those commands can be pushed to do far greater things: Gameplay mechanics, features, logic, and the list goes on - but this came at a cost: developing them was often unintuitive or difficult, and many things that are easily expressible in normal programming languages are either cumbersome or very difficult to represent using only commands.

It's clear that Minecraft's commands were never meant to be used this way, and although Minecraft has taken steps to make the lives of datapack developers easier, the system itself hasn't changed.

Sculk is a scripting language designed to abstract away all the awkwardness and burdens that come with using raw commands, so you can focus more on your datapack and less on scratching your head trying to wrangle the game to suit your needs.
